## What is Pool Hiring?

Pool hiring is a technique Intuit uses to pool resources across many teams to make hiring top talent efficient, while maintaining a high bar for talent. 
In order to maintain consistency and remove implicit biases, it's important that we standardize across the all of the teams the questions we are asking and 
the way we are evaluating the candidates we interview. This repository aims to be the place where we consolidate the questions. 

## Who Made This?

This was created by a tiger team of individuals who were brought together to build the standard. We expect that by the time you're reading this, 
most of the content will be contributed by assessors throughout all of Intuit.

## Contributing Questions

We *need* your help!! We are always looking for contributors to help us keep this repository populated with high-quality and fresh content.

Please see the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you are interested in helping out.
