# How to reference external files?
If you are creating a question that requires sharing static content such as images, json or txt files, then apply the following steps 
to ensure these contents are shared in a secure and consistent fashion.

## Steps to create externally shareable folders

1. Create a new folder in [Intuit's Box](https://intuit.app.box.com/folder/0) and apply the following permission changes on the Folder:
    * Assign the Repo [SuperAdmins](https://github.intuit.com/orgs/poolhiring/teams/a4a-superadmin/members) as Co-owners. This allows co-owners to change the files, if needed, in future.
