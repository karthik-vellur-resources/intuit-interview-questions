### Description

`Long-form description of the problem statement, including any skeleton or context.`

### Links to Extra Files or References

`Add any extra content that doesn't fit into this doc`

### Preparation Instructions to be Shared in Advance

`To be shared with the candidate before the interview, so that they are prepared. Examples include environment, IDE, DBs, etc.`

## Intuit Internal ONLY (Do not share with candidate)

Estimated time to complete: `X minutes`

### Common Clarification Questions/FAQ
`Any expected clarification questions from candidate for this interview`

### Solution

`Description of the solution in english language`

#### Possible Approaches

`If applicable, elaborate on various approaches that could be taken to solve this problem`

#### Sample Solution

```
Long form code or artifact expected to be produced by the candidate.
```

#### Time Complexity
`Complexity, if applicable of this approach.`

### How to Assess Candidate / Expected Answer by Level
`Provide guidance in minutes / answer expectation for different roles`

Example: 
```
A strong SWE2 candidate should be able to converge on the brute force solution within 20 minutes and show progress towards optimal solution with hints.
A strong SSE candidate should be able to converge on the optimal solution with some handholding within 30 minutes.
A strong Staff candidate should be able to converge on the optimal solution within 15 minutes with no hints.

Also, questions that we would like the candidate to ask are also useful.
Edge cases identified, etc.
```
