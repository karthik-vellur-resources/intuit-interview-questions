# SWE 2 Render data from a service - Share with Candidate - Public

## Description

Develop a React app that renders data from a service:

* Example: https://reduxblog.herokuapp.com/api/posts?key=123 
* Render the data in a list format and only render the title and the content fields for each entry

## Links to Extra Files or References

* Here's a blank React fiddle(if needed): https://jsfiddle.net/o0az8p9b/
* React Boilerplate (if needed): https://jsfiddle.net/x7na2Lsq/

## Preparation Instructions to be Shared in Advance

Use either codepen or glider.


# Intuit Internal ONLY Do Not Share with Candidate

Estimated time to complete: 15-20 minutes.

A strong candidate should be able to finish this relatively quickly. Here are some follow-up requirements:

* Display title and content in a table 
* Give them some time to make the table visually appealing
* Sort the list of items by title or content.

### Skills tested by this question
* React
* New react hooks (if they used them)
* React state management
* CSS
* Some data manipulation

## Solution

### Approach:

As for most UI work, ideally they start by putting the components on the page so that
 
1. They can ensure their environment works and 
2. They can start fetching the data and displaying it.

But here's an ideal approach:

1. Candidate asks any clarifying questions
2. Draws out or thinks about their approach, explaining it in words before coding right away.
3. Sets up react component, fetches data and renders the title and content fields in list format .
5. Makes the component visually appealing by adding some CSS

### How to Assess Candidate

Generally this problem should only be used for SWE2.

A strong candidate should be able to solve this relatively quickly, giving some indication that they are able to do a simple set up of react component, fetch data and render it.


## Additional notes

This question should be relatively easy for someone who works with react regularly.
