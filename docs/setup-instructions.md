# Setup Instructions for Craft Demos

## Prerequisites
The Recruiter should share the following information with the candidate prior to the interview day:

### Summary of Exercise: 
Be prepared to build a backend web service and implement REST endpoints.

### Laptop Environment:
- IDE of your choice for coding and testing
- Strongest programming language
- Frameworks/libraries appropriate for the language choice
- Technology to package and run your solution (Docker, Maven, Gradle etc.)
- Optional: Database of choice (could also be an in-memory database)
- Optional: Online resources such as open source tools, SDKs, etc.

## Craft Exercise
The Setup Assessor should share the exercise with the candidate on the day of the interview during the 15-minute Greeting/Setup time.

### To send the exercise
- Copy and paste the following problem statement into your email
- Download any relevant file(s) from the craft problem and attach to your email
- Once sent, ensure that the candidate is able to see the problem and attached files

### Setup Assessor Best Practices:
- Walk the candidate through the problem statement to ensure that the candidate understands what they should focus on in the 90-minutes

- Candidates are encouraged to ask questions/clarify expectations with the Setup Assessor during the Setup time.  Please be prepared to answer questions or talk through the ideas they share with you.  Use best judgement when responding to questions/clarifying expectations.  The goal is to share enough to set the candidate up for success. 

- The exercise is a solo-working session.  The candidate is not expected to be on video or share their screen during this time.  

- The Setup Assessor is expected to be available during the 90-minutes exercise in case the candidate has questions/comments during the exercise.  In a virtual environment, Setup Assessors will remain on the video conference line.  The Setup Assessor may turn off their video and audio until the candidate addresses them

- Check in on the candidate partial way through

- Share feedback about the Setup (questions asked by the candidate, any technical issues, observations, etc.)  to the A4A team in real time (ideally via Slack).  This will help prepare the A4A team for what to expect during the Craft Demonstration

## FAQs
- What database am I allowed to use?
    - For the database, you can use in-memory database, you are welcome to use a persistent data store of your choice. 

- What tools are available to me during this time?
    - You are encouraged but not required to take advantage of a service code-generation framework of your choice when performing this exercise.  You are free to also use online resources, including Google Search and Stack Overflow, if needed

- What should I focus on if I anticipate I may not have time to complete everything?
    - The problem statement is very open about the coding language, framework and database. It is allowed to use anything to make the API working. We set the expectation that the code/API should work and they have their good reasons about the decisions they make during the exercise.
